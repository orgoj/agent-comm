**Agent-agnostic intercommunication system.** Lets AI coding agents — Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, or any custom tool — talk to each other, share state, and coordinate work in real time.

## Why

When you run multiple AI agents on the same codebase — code review in one terminal, implementation in another, testing in a third — they have no idea the others exist. They duplicate work, create merge conflicts, and miss context.

|                   | Without agent-comm                   | With agent-comm                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discovery**     | Agents don't know others exist       | Agents register with skills, discover by capability  |
| **Coordination**  | Edit the same file, create conflicts | Lock files/regions, divide work                      |
| **Communication** | None — each agent works blind        | Messages, channels, broadcasts                       |
| **State sharing** | Duplicate work, missed context       | Shared KV store with atomic CAS                      |
| **Visibility**    | No idea what's happening             | Real-time dashboard + activity feed shows everything |

**agent-comm** gives them a shared communication layer:

- Agents **register** with a name, capabilities, and skills so others can discover them
- They **discover** each other by skill or tag for dynamic task routing
- They exchange **messages** (direct, broadcast, or channel-based) to coordinate, with importance levels (`low`/`normal`/`high`/`urgent`) and optional ack
- They **poll** their inbox with a blocking wait (`comm_poll`) so mid-flight peer signals are consumed without busy-looping
- They share **state** (a key-value store with atomic CAS) for locks, flags, and progress
- They log **activity events** (commits, test results, file edits) to a shared feed
- They detect **stuck agents** — alive (heartbeat OK) but not making progress
- They **serialize file edits** via the system-layer `file-coord` hook (see below) so parallel agents on shared files cannot clobber each other
- A **web dashboard** shows everything in real time, including an Activity Feed tab

It works with any agent that supports [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (stdio transport) or can make HTTP requests (REST API).

### Why hooks, not just MCP tools

The MCP tools (`comm_state`, etc.) give agents the _primitives_ to coordinate, but they don't _enforce_ coordination — the agent has to remember to call them. Our [bench](bench/README.md) measured what happens when you rely on the model's discretion: **even with strict procedural prompting, Claude follows the protocol on the first claim cycle then drifts back to "be helpful, finish the task."** Soft coordination is unreliable.

The fix is a pair of `PreToolUse` hooks shipped in `scripts/hooks/`: **`file-coord`** intercepts every `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` and claims the file via REST `POST /api/state/file-locks/<path>/cas` (blocks the edit if another agent holds the lock); **`bash-guard`** intercepts `git commit`, `git push`, `npm install`, `npm test`, builds, migrations, and dev-server starts and blocks/warns when they would conflict with another session's WIP. **The protocol becomes infrastructure, not a prompt the agent might ignore.**

The bench's headline pilot is **`multi-term-commit`** — directly modeling the daily pain of two terminal sessions on the same project. Session A edits two files but doesn't commit. Session B then edits two other files and runs `git commit -am "my work"`. Without the hook, B's commit silently includes A's WIP. With the hook, B's commit is blocked at the bash layer with an actionable message, and B reacts (selective staging, restore, or coordinate). Bench result:

|               | naive (no hook)                            | **with hooks**            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Commit purity | **MIXED** — bar.js, baz.js, foo.js, qux.js | **PURE — baz.js, qux.js** |
| Wall time     | 91.0s                                      | **78.8s (-13%)**          |
| Total cost    | $0.774                                     | **$0.591 (-24%)**         |
| Outcome       | A's WIP silently committed under B's name  | clean commit, no clobber  |

The hook is **faster AND cheaper**, not just safer. Reason: when agents lack coordination on shared workspaces, they read stale state, get confused mid-task, retry, and re-think. Serializing access and surfacing the conflict early removes that wasted thinking. Run `npm run setup` to install both hooks automatically; see [Setup → File Coordination](docs/SETUP.md#pretooluse--posttooluse--scriptshooksfile-coordmjs) for manual install on Claude Code, OpenCode, or any custom MCP client. See [bench/README.md](bench/README.md) for the measurement methodology.

### How agent-comm fits together

`agent-comm` is a single Node process that exposes three transports — MCP stdio (for AI hosts), REST + WebSocket (for hooks, dashboards, custom scripts) — backed by a SQLite database in WAL mode. Hooks installed in your Claude Code (or other host) settings call the REST endpoint at `localhost:3421` to claim file locks, query who-edited-what, and broadcast presence. The dashboard UI at the same port is a live view of every agent, message, channel, and shared-state entry. Multiple AI hosts can connect simultaneously and see the same world.

## Quick start

### Install from npm

```bash
npm install -g agent-comm
```

### Or clone from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keshrath/agent-comm.git
cd agent-comm
npm install
npm run build
```

### Option 1: MCP server (for any MCP-compatible AI host)

agent-comm runs as a stdio MCP server, so any MCP-compatible host can use it.
Tested hosts include Claude Code, Cline, OpenCode, Cursor (read-only state),
Windsurf, Codex CLI, Aider, and Continue.dev. Adapter recipes for each are in
[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#client-setup).

Generic MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-comm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-comm"]
    }
  }
}
```

Add this to your host's MCP config file (the path varies by host —
`~/.claude.json` for Claude Code, `~/.config/opencode/config.json` for
OpenCode, `~/.cursor/config.json` for Cursor, etc. — see the per-host
sections in `docs/SETUP.md`).

The dashboard auto-starts at http://localhost:3421 on the first MCP connection
regardless of which host is connected.

### Option 2: Standalone server (for REST/WebSocket clients)

```bash
node dist/server.js --port 3421
```

### Option 3: Automated setup (Claude Code)

```bash
npm run setup
```

Registers the MCP server in `~/.claude.json`, installs the [hook scripts](docs/SETUP.md#hooks) (lifecycle + file-coord + bash-guard), and configures permissions. **Other hosts**: see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md#client-setup) for the per-host integration recipes — every host that supports pre-tool-call hooks can use the same `file-coord.mjs` script unchanged.

```

## Agent visibility and status

`comm_agents` with `action: "heartbeat"` accepts an optional `status_text` parameter, letting agents update their visible status in the same call that keeps them online:

```jsonc
// MCP call — heartbeat + status update in one
comm_agents({ "action": "heartbeat", "status_text": "implementing auth module" })

// Clear status text (pass null)
comm_agents({ "action": "heartbeat", "status_text": null })

// Plain heartbeat — status text unchanged
comm_agents({ "action": "heartbeat" })
```

**Hosts that support lifecycle hooks** (Claude Code, OpenCode, future Cursor/Codex when they ship hook APIs) get automatic heartbeats, registration, and status via the lifecycle hook scripts shipped in `scripts/hooks/`. Subagents spawned by the Agent tool inherit the same registration via `SubagentStart`, so they appear on the dashboard alongside the main session. **Hosts without hook support** (Cursor, Windsurf, Aider as of 2025) can still use the MCP tools — agents must call `comm_register` and `comm_agents heartbeat` from the host's instructions file. **Custom MCP clients or scripts** can call the REST endpoints or use `comm_heartbeat` directly to show live progress.

The REST endpoint `GET /api/agents/:id/heartbeat` returns agent liveness info (status, heartbeat age in ms/s, status text) for external monitoring.

## Communication patterns

### Direct messaging

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent A
    participant S as agent-comm
    participant B as Agent B

    A->>S: comm_send(to B, content review PR 42)
    Note over S: Store in SQLite, emit event
    B->>S: comm_inbox()
    S-->>B: message from A
    B->>S: comm_reply(message_id 1, LGTM merging)
```

### Shared state with CAS (distributed locking)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent A
    participant S as agent-comm
    participant B as Agent B

    A->>S: comm_state(action cas, key deploy-lock, new agent-a)
    S-->>A: swapped true
    B->>S: comm_state(action cas, key deploy-lock, new agent-b)
    S-->>B: swapped false
    Note over B: Lock held by agent-a, back off
```

## Dashboard

![Messages View](docs/screenshots/messages.png)

The web dashboard auto-starts at **http://localhost:3421** and shows agents, messages, channels, shared state, and the activity feed in real time. See the [Dashboard Guide](docs/DASHBOARD.md) for all views and features.
