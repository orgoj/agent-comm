Agent cards display capability tags, status text, heartbeat age, and message counts. Click any card to filter messages by that agent.

### Activity Feed

Unified timeline of structured events across all agents. Filter by event type (commit, test_pass, error, file_edit, task_complete, etc.).

## WebSocket protocol

Dashboard connects via WebSocket for real-time updates:

- **On connect:** receives full state snapshot (`type: "state"`) with `agents`, `channels`, `messages`, `messageCount`, `state`, `feed`, `branches`
- **Per event:** receives incremental updates (`agent:registered`, `message:sent`, `state:changed`, etc.)
- **Send `{ "type": "refresh" }`** to request a fresh full state
- **Event subscription:** send `{ "type": "subscribe", "events": ["message:sent", "agent:registered"] }` to filter events
- Ping/pong heartbeat every 30s for connection health detection
- Max 50 concurrent WebSocket connections
