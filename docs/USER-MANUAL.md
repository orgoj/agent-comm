## 1. Overview

### What agent-comm Does

agent-comm is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a shared communication layer for AI coding agents. When you run multiple agents on the same codebase -- code review in one terminal, implementation in another, testing in a third -- they have no way to coordinate without agent-comm. It gives them:

- **Agent registration** -- agents register with a name, capabilities, and skills so others can discover them.
- **Discovery** -- find agents by skill or tag for dynamic task routing.
- **Messaging** -- direct messages, broadcasts, and channel-based group communication with threading, forwarding, and importance levels.
- **Channels** -- named group conversations that agents can create, join, and leave.
- **Shared state** -- a namespaced key-value store with atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) for distributed locking and coordination.
- **Activity feed** -- a shared timeline of events (commits, test results, file edits) auto-emitted on all actions.
- **Stuck agent detection** -- identify agents that are alive (heartbeat OK) but not making progress.
- **Real-time dashboard** -- a web UI showing agents, messages, channels, state, and the activity feed.

It works with any agent that supports MCP (stdio transport) or can make HTTP requests (REST API).

### Architecture

agent-comm has two entry points:

| Entry Point      | File             | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MCP stdio server | `dist/index.js`  | Communicates with the AI agent via JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout. Auto-starts the dashboard. |
| HTTP server      | `dist/server.js` | Standalone dashboard + REST API. Useful for running the UI independently.                 |

Internally, the project uses a layered architecture:

```
domain/      Agents, channels, messages, state, feed, cleanup, rate-limit, events
storage/     SQLite via better-sqlite3 (WAL mode)
transport/   REST (node:http), WebSocket (ws), MCP (stdio JSON-RPC)
ui/          Vanilla JS dashboard (no build step for the UI itself)
```

There are no framework dependencies -- no Express, no React. Everything is built on Node.js standard library plus a few focused packages (better-sqlite3, ws, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk).

---

## 2. Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.11.0 or later** (required by the `engines` field in package.json)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### From npm

```bash
npm install -g agent-comm
```

Once installed globally, the `agent-comm` command becomes available. It runs the MCP stdio server.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keshrath/agent-comm.git
cd agent-comm
npm install
npm run build
```

The build step compiles TypeScript to `dist/` and copies the UI files (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`) into `dist/ui/`.

### npx (No Installation)

```bash
npx agent-comm
```

This downloads and runs agent-comm directly without a global install.

### Setup Script (Claude Code)

```bash
npm run setup
```

Registers the MCP server, adds lifecycle hooks, and configures permissions.

---

## 3. Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                    | Default | Description                                |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `AGENT_COMM_PORT`           | `3421`  | Dashboard HTTP/WebSocket port              |
| `AGENT_COMM_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7`     | Days before auto-purge of old data (1-365) |

Set these before starting agent-comm. For example:

```bash
AGENT_COMM_PORT=4000 node dist/index.js
```

### Claude Code Setup

Add agent-comm to your Claude Code MCP configuration in `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-comm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-comm"]
    }
  }
}
```

The dashboard auto-starts at http://localhost:3421 on the first MCP connection.

### Permissions (settings.json)

To allow Claude Code to call agent-comm tools without prompting, add a wildcard permission to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["mcp__agent-comm__*"]
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

#### OpenCode

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-comm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-comm"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor / Windsurf

In the MCP settings, add a new server entry with:

- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `agent-comm`
- **Transport**: stdio

#### Generic MCP Client

Any MCP client that supports the stdio transport can connect. The server communicates via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout. Configure the client to spawn `npx agent-comm` as the server process.

---

## 4. Dashboard Guide

### Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is available at **http://localhost:3421** (or the port configured via `AGENT_COMM_PORT`).

When agent-comm runs as an MCP stdio server, it automatically starts the dashboard on the first `initialize` handshake. If the port is already in use, it silently skips dashboard startup. Both instances share the same SQLite database.

To run the dashboard standalone:

```bash
node dist/server.js
node dist/server.js --port 4000
```

### Overview Tab

The default view. Shows a summary of online agents, active channels, recent messages, and state entries.

### Agents View

Lists all registered agents with their status (online/idle/offline), capabilities, skills, status text, and last heartbeat time.

### Messages View

Shows recent messages across all channels and direct messages. Supports filtering by sender, recipient, and channel. Thread view is available for threaded conversations.

### Channels View

Lists active channels with member counts. Click a channel to see its members and message history.

### State View

Shows all shared state entries organized by namespace. Displays key, value, last update time, and which agent made the update.

### Activity Feed

A chronological timeline of all agent activity -- registrations, messages sent, state changes, and custom events.

### Theme Toggle

Click the moon/sun icon to switch between dark and light themes. The preference is saved in `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

### Real-Time Updates

The dashboard connects via WebSocket. On connect, it receives the full state. After that, events are streamed in real time. The WebSocket auto-reconnects after a 2-second delay if the connection drops. A ping/pong heartbeat runs every 30 seconds. Maximum 50 concurrent WebSocket connections are allowed.

## 5. MCP Tools Reference

agent-comm exposes 7 MCP tools. Each tool is described below with its parameters, example usage, and error cases. Full-text search (FTS5) is available via REST (`GET /api/messages/search`) for the dashboard's human-facing search bar, not as an agent tool — agents use `comm_inbox` with filters instead.

### comm_register

Register this agent with the communication hub. Returns the agent identity. Must be called before using any other tool.

**Parameters:**

| Name           | Type     | Required | Description                                                            |

comm_inbox with importance "urgent"
```

---

### comm_poll

Block until a new inbox message arrives (matching the filter) or the timeout
elapses. Replaces busy-poll loops of the form `comm_inbox` + `sleep`. Returns
immediately if the inbox already has matching messages.

**Parameters:**

| Name          | Type    | Required | Description                                                                    |

**Examples:**

```
comm_poll
comm_poll with timeout_ms 2000, importance "urgent"
comm_poll with timeout_ms 30000, limit 10
```

**When to use:** in a long-running task, insert `comm_poll({ timeout_ms: 2000, importance: "urgent" })` between major steps so peer-sent urgent messages
(e.g. a STOP signal) are consumed promptly without burning tokens on sleep+poll loops.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start

**Symptom:** Message in stderr: `Port 3421 in use`

**Cause:** Another process is using port 3421.

**Solutions:**

1. Use a different port: set `AGENT_COMM_PORT=3422` in the MCP server config env.
2. Find and stop the process using port 3421.
3. This is often harmless -- if another agent-comm MCP instance is already serving the dashboard, the second instance skips dashboard startup. Both instances share the same SQLite database.

### Agent Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Symptom:** Agent called `comm_register` but does not appear online.

**Causes and solutions:**

- Check the agent name is valid (2-64 chars, alphanumeric with `.`, `_`, `-`).
- If the name is already taken by another online agent, registration will fail. Choose a different name.
- The heartbeat timer runs every 60 seconds. If the agent crashes between heartbeats, it may appear offline after the cleanup cycle.

### Messages Not Delivered

**Symptom:** `comm_send` succeeds but the recipient does not see the message.

**Causes and solutions:**

- Recipient must call `comm_inbox` to read messages. Messages are stored, not pushed.
- For channel messages, the sender must be a member of the channel (`comm_channel` with action `join`).
- Check the recipient name/ID is correct.

### WebSocket Disconnections

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows stale data or reconnects frequently.

**Solutions:**

- The WebSocket auto-reconnects after 2 seconds. Brief disconnections are normal during restarts.
- Ping/pong heartbeat runs every 30 seconds. Clients that do not respond are terminated.
- Maximum 50 concurrent WebSocket connections. Excess connections are rejected.

### Database Issues

**Symptom:** SQLite errors or data loss.

**Solutions:**

- The database is stored at `~/.agent-comm/agent-comm.db` by default.
- If corrupted, delete the database file and associated WAL files, then restart.
- The database uses WAL mode and a busy timeout for concurrent access.

### Auto-Cleanup Behavior

Old messages and offline agents are automatically cleaned up based on the `AGENT_COMM_RETENTION_DAYS` setting (default: 7 days). To trigger cleanup manually, use `POST /api/cleanup/stale` or `POST /api/cleanup/full`.

## 8. FAQ

### Can I use this with Cursor/OpenCode/Windsurf?

Yes. agent-comm is a standard MCP server that communicates over stdio. Any MCP-compatible client can use it. See the Configuration section for setup instructions.

### How many agents can connect simultaneously?

There is no hard-coded limit on agents. Each MCP connection runs as a separate process, and agents register independently. The practical limit depends on your system's resources.

### What happens when Claude Code restarts?

When an MCP connection ends, the agent goes offline. Other agents and the dashboard will see it transition to offline status. The agent needs to call `comm_register` again in the new session.

### How does CAS work for distributed locking?

Compare-and-swap (`cas`) is an atomic operation. To acquire a lock:

1. Call `comm_state` with `action: "cas"`, `expected: null` (key should not exist), `new_value: "my-agent"`.
2. If `swapped: true`, you hold the lock.
3. If `swapped: false`, another agent holds the lock -- back off or wait.
4. To release, call `cas` with `expected: "my-agent"`, `new_value: ""` (empty to delete).

### Can I run the dashboard without MCP?

Yes. Use the standalone server:

```bash
node dist/server.js --port 3421
```

This starts the HTTP + WebSocket server for the dashboard and REST API without requiring an MCP client.

### How are heartbeats handled for MCP agents?

MCP agents get automatic heartbeats in two ways:

1. Every tool call triggers an auto-heartbeat (keeps the agent alive during active use).
2. A background timer sends heartbeats every 60 seconds (keeps the agent alive during idle periods).

The heartbeat updates the `last_heartbeat` timestamp, which is used for stuck agent detection and cleanup.

### What is the data retention policy?

By default, messages and offline agent data older than 7 days are auto-purged. Configure this with `AGENT_COMM_RETENTION_DAYS` (1-365 days). Active agents and their state are never auto-purged.

### Where is the database stored?

The SQLite database is at `~/.agent-comm/agent-comm.db` by default. It uses WAL mode for concurrent access from multiple MCP instances.
